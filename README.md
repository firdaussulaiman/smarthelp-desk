# smarthelp-desk
SmartHelp Desk is a modern, modular ticketing system for internal IT support and service desk operations. The application is built with a React frontend (using Vite), a Node.js + Express backend, and a MongoDB Atlas database.

This project is structured for scalable growth, with planned integration of:

🔐 Microsoft Entra ID (for secure Microsoft login)

📬 Microsoft Graph API (to send Outlook emails and Teams alerts)

☁️ Azure deployment (via Terraform and CI/CD pipelines)

It’s designed to mimic real-world enterprise infrastructure, making it suitable for learning full-stack app development and cloud engineering practices.
